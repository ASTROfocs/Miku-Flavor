# Miku-Flavor v0.1
A self-installing rice for Debian-based Linux distributions using X11.

What has always bothered me about Linux ricing is that it is seen as something that is Arch-exclusive and often very difficult to do. Frankly, no. Every distribution that supports a DE can be riced, including beginner-friendly ones like Mint.

This rice is supposed to be simple to install and use. As I will update it I will also include some simple commentary on how it is built and how rices are generally built.

The present version is v0.1 - it should work without problems, but the installing script is not checked for installation failures and the rice itself needs more work to make it nicer.

TODO:
  - Improve colorscheme
  - Add error-handling to install script
  - Improve blur in picom
  - Write-up on how rices work
